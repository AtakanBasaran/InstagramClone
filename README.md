# InstagramClone
In this project, basic Instagram app is created via Swift. Users can sign in, up and out with their emails and passwords via Firebase, share multiple photos with PHPickerViewController and show them with ImageSlideshow in the home page tab bar. Users can also like and unlike the posts, comment other users posts. In addition, users can delete their own posts in the home page and delete their comments for other users posts.
